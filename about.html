      <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
      <P>Tempus Fugit is a unique watch gallery established by Elara Vance with the mission to serve people by offering
        a deeper connection to timepieces. Unlike typical retail stores, it focuses on the stories, history, and
        craftsmanship of watches, treating them as meaningful objects rather than just luxury goods. The gallery
        provides a space for learning and appreciation, where staff act as curators and build a community, helping
        individuals find watches that resonate with their personal history and needs, ultimately becoming a place of
        connection and understanding.</P>

    <h2>History of Watches</h2>
    <p>
      The history of watches
      began in the 15th century with the development of portable,
      spring-driven clocks, evolving from larger timekeeping devices.
      Initially inaccurate and primarily ornamental, these early clock-watches
      were worn as pendants. The 17th century saw the rise of pocket watches,
      spurred by changing fashion and the practicality of carrying timepieces
      in waistcoats. Key innovations like the balance spring significantly
      improved accuracy, leading to the addition of minute hands. Further
      advancements like the fusee and lever escapement continued to enhance
      performance in mechanical movements over the following centuries. While
      wristwatches existed, they were mainly considered women's jewelry until
      World War I, when their practicality for soldiers in the trenches led to
      their widespread adoption by men after the war. The late 20th century
      brought a major shift with the introduction of quartz watches. Utilizing
      a vibrating quartz crystal for timekeeping, these watches offered
      superior accuracy and became more affordable to produce, significantly
      impacting the traditional mechanical watch industry. Today, the watch
      continues to evolve, with mechanical watches prized for their
      craftsmanship and heritage, and smartwatches emerging as
      multi-functional devices that integrate timekeeping with advanced
      digital capabilities.
