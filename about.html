      <h2>History of Watches</h2>
      <p>
       The history of watches
        began in the 15th century with the development of portable,
        spring-driven clocks, evolving from larger timekeeping devices.
        Initially inaccurate and primarily ornamental, these early clock-watches
        were worn as pendants. The 17th century saw the rise of pocket watches,
        spurred by changing fashion and the practicality of carrying timepieces
        in waistcoats. Key innovations like the balance spring significantly
        improved accuracy, leading to the addition of minute hands. Further
        advancements like the fusee and lever escapement continued to enhance
        performance in mechanical movements over the following centuries. While
        wristwatches existed, they were mainly considered women's jewelry until
        World War I, when their practicality for soldiers in the trenches led to
        their widespread adoption by men after the war. The late 20th century
        brought a major shift with the introduction of quartz watches. Utilizing
        a vibrating quartz crystal for timekeeping, these watches offered
        superior accuracy and became more affordable to produce, significantly
        impacting the traditional mechanical watch industry. Today, the watch
        continues to evolve, with mechanical watches prized for their
        craftsmanship and heritage, and smartwatches emerging as
        multi-functional devices that integrate timekeeping with advanced
        digital capabilities.
